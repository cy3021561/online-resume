    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <ul>
      <p>
        I am a highly motivated and well-prepared graduate student specializing
        in Computer Science, with a particular focus on Artificial Intelligence.
        Alongside my specialization, I have gained valuable experience in Web
        development and Game development.
        <br />
        As a software developer, I find it exhilarating to witness the
        continuous evolution of technology, and I strongly believe that a good
        developer should always prioritize continuous learning. That is
        precisely why I decided to pursue an additional degree in Computer
        Science in the United States after leaving my previous job. I have an
        unwavering passion for acquiring new knowledge and honing my skills, as
        I firmly believe that maintaining a learning mindset is essential for
        professional growth.
        <br />
        To summarize, I am confident that with this attitude, I can bring
        significant value to any organization. I warmly welcome you to reach out
        to me or explore my projects on my GitHub page. It would be my pleasure
        to connect with you. Thank you for your consideration.
